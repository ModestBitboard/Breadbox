# Breadbox
Breadbox is a REST API for anime, manga, games, and linux ISOs (for some reason).

It supports signed URLs, API keys, users, and a whole bunch more little things like that.

You can easily add your own archive to your Breadbox by creating a new python file in the `routers` directory and using some of the built-in tools.

# Why?
*"Who I am is in these episodes" - AJR, "Netflix Trip"*

Put simply, I've seen a lot of anime and read a little bit of manga. I enjoy it both as a medium and a way to unwind. I also appreciate it for the tough times it's gotten me through.
I know it's not likely, but the concept of these pieces of my youth becoming lost media, or suffering a similar fate, scares me.
With DRM and greedy companies fighting over who can milk the most profits out of their customers, I feel less like a fan and more like livestock.

I made Breadbox because I want to preserve those pieces of media that made me--and continue to make me--who I am.

# That's cool! Is there any way I can access it?
At this point in time, not officially. I haven't opened Breadbox up to the public yet for a multitude of reasons. One of which is not wanting to get sued by some schmuck copyright troll.
I might at some point. Perhaps I'll create a page where people can apply to gain access, allowing me to prevent malicious parties from gaining access to the archive and it's users.

I'd love to make this project even bigger. Opening this up to the public would invite curious minds to attempt their own improvements, interfaces, and archives.
But right now, unfortunately, it'll remain closed. However, everyone is welcome to use this project's code for their own archives. Compitition only makes us stronger.

If you pester me about it, by making issues or messaging me saying "Akito, can I have access?" then I might give you access if you're harmless and kind. Just don't harrass or spam me about it, okay? I'm only one person.

If you're going to take time out of both of our days to bug me about it, then please, at least take the next section into consideration.

## Support
If you liked this project, go ahead and give it a star. And if you really ***really*** like it, consider sending me a tip.
